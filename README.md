# Lunatic Fringe
Lunatic Fringe is a game beloved by those of us who had the privilege to play it back in the early 90s. It has a special charm that has not been replicated in games since. 

Lunatic Fringe is at risk of being lost to time. The original After Dark module only works in classic OS 9 and below. A group at [Sealie Software](http://www.sealiesoftware.com/fringe/) has created a wrapper that allows it to work on OS X, but support for their method was dropped in OS X Lion. No version has ever worked on Windows. From now on, the ability to play Lunatic Fringe is waning.

This project is an attempt to recreate Lunatic Fringe using web technologies. When finished, the game will be able to be enjoyed by anyone with a modern web browser on any platform and OS of their choosing.
